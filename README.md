**`computer nerd`**

I'm a current student at the University of Illinois Chicago studying computer science. I'm currently interested in Full-Stack web development, and learning how to automate the annoying things in my life. Projects found in repositories are started once the pre-planning and white-boarding is done, and the next iterations are planned once I think up of cooler ideas to add. Every project is worked on untill finished.
